### Tips 


Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which using the `node` command in Vagrant.

Work on your code iterartively - that means in small pieces.

to help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values as follows.

```javascript
function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime) {
  console.log("hungry is", hungry);
  console.log("availableTime is", availableTime);
}
```
